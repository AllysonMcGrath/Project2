# Tavern Cafe

This is a website, where a user can log into their account and interact with other users that all share a love for RPG's.

The account into would hold their character name, basic info, and a few stats.

They will then enter a lobby where they can interact (future development) with other account characters and share info about their adventures. 

The more they interact with other characters, the more social stats they will have which allow them to (future development) join a clan. 

Once a clan is formed, (future development) the clan can partake in adventures/mini-games to boost other stats.
